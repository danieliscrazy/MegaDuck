# MegaDuck
> This project was made for Hack Club's High Seas program.

This board is a custom Arduino Mega 2560 board in the shape of a duck. Why? Because ducks are cool. I like ducks. I would've made it more customized, but I was a bit crunched for time. ![3D_PCB1_1_2025-01-31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a0b6320-1a3e-4528-af4f-9dfed160ba1e)
